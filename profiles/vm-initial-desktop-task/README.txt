This folder is a GNOME layout snapshot exported from the source machine.

Profile changes in this tuned lab version:
- Window controls are placed on the left as close, maximize/restore, minimize.
- The bluetooth-battery@young panel extension is included and enabled, with BlueZ and UPower battery sources.
- The codex-usage@young panel extension uses only an icon in the top panel.
- The Codex usage icon uses an outer 5-hour usage ring and fills the inner C glyph with weekly remaining usage.
- Detailed Codex percentages remain available from the indicator menu.

Files:
- gsettings-export.sh : replayable GNOME settings commands
- dconf-org-gnome.ini : full /org/gnome/ dconf dump
- extensions/         : copied local shell extensions, if any

To import on another GNOME machine:
